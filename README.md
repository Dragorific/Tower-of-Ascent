# Tower of Ascent
The Tower of Ascent project is a Unity3D game created as a learning exercise to practice game development with Unity and C#. This simple project is an in-progress game that allows the developer to explore various Unity mechanics, particularly through gameplay that involves ascending levels, potentially with obstacles or challenges along the way.

## The repository includes the following elements:
### Programming Language: Primarily C#.
### Core Files: A minimal set of Unity and C# files that define the projectâ€™s structure, with a basic README.md describing it as a development exercise in Unity.

The project has yet to include extensive gameplay features or a detailed README, indicating that it's more of a sandbox for development learning than a fully-fledged game at this stage.
